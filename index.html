  <a id="myText">a film by <b class="link">CLÁUDIA VAREJÃO</b><br><br>
    Aristophanes, in his speech in the <b>Symposium</b>, presents us with an unique vision of love: in the beginning, human beings had a single body, with four legs, four arms and two faces. These beings were fundamentally safe and invincible, to the point of defying the gods and trying to ascend to the heavens. Zeus, worried and uncompromising, retaliated against their audacity by throwing a lightning bolt that divided them into two halves: on each side was a being with two legs, two arms, one face and one gender. Since that day, on this earth, the two halves have been constantly searching for each other.<br><br>

	The aim of Amor Fati is to seek out these halves that have converged again today, as if they were chemical elements attracted in the same direction. The present is a moment of destiny in which the parts merge without being influenced by reason: they are creatures of intuition. They do not long to be in any other place, have no desire for a different future or past. They wish to ascend, together – and again – to meet Zeus. But anyone who thinks that Aristophanes’ gaze only referred to a (re)encounter between bodies is destined for disappointemt. Perhaps he spoke to us, above all, about absence as a vital condition and the path that we must travel alone. Disparity as the constant basis of encounters.<br><br>

	For two years, I  have travelled around Portugal, from north to south, looking for stories of unshakable love, which were expressed, at first glance, in similar physical features. I met with hundreds of peers and groups who were right at that moment living stories of rare bonding. I filmed without knowing how all of these stories would form a narrative. Later, during editing, I placed them side by side, hoping that the rhymes and delicacies of chance would emerge. The lives of some echoed in the lives of others. And the achievements of some filled the empty spaces of others.  I’d like to say <span id="myBtn" class="link"><b>thank you</b></span> to everyone that was part of this journey.</a>
